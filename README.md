# Pizzeria
Pizzeria is a very basic Python shell script to get you the best bang for your buck while buying pizza.  Enter in the diameter, price, and a few notes for the pizzas you want to compare.  Pizzeria will then calculate the price per square inch and output a table, ordering by value from best to worst.
## Sample Output
	Price  | Diameter | $/sq. in. | Notes
	=========================================
	$    5 |       12 | $  0.0442 | Little Caesars
	$   11 |       16 | $  0.0547 | Pizza Guys
	$  9.5 |       14 | $  0.0617 | Pizza Pit
